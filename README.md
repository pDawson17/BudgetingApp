# BudgetingApp
## Project Overview
Easy to use budgeting app that fits all of your necessary information for any given budgeting period onto one page. 
I created this app in the summer of 2018 because I wanted a budgeting app that didn't require me to enter any more 
information than I wanted to submit. This application does not take any personal information, only how much you'd
like to spend during any specified or unspecified time period.

## Usage
Boot the app up, press "Start a New Budgeting Period" and input the amount of money you want to spend, and then
decide which categories you'd like to specify amounts for individually. Afterwards, simply input your expenditures
every time you have a chance and the app will keep track of all of your spending and provide graphics and statistics.

## File Structure
For this application I wanted to try and keep all the code as simple as possible. The entire application is run from
one page, inside the source file.
