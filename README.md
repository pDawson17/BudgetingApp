# BudgetingApp
## Project Overview
Easy to use budgeting app that fits all of your necessary information for any given budgeting period onto one page. 
I created this app in the summer of 2018 because I wanted an app that would help me track my spending during my next year in college without requiring me to create a new account, link my credit card, and worry about the security of my personal information.

The only data this application takese is how much you'd like to spend during any unspecified time period.

## Usage
Boot the app up, press "Start a New Budgeting Period" and input the amount of money you want to spend. Then
decide which categories you'd like to specify amounts for individually. Next, simply input your expenditures
every time you have a chance and the app will keep track of all of your spending and provide graphics and statistics.

## File Structure
For this application I wanted to try and keep all the code as simple as possible. The entire application is run from
one page, inside the source file.
